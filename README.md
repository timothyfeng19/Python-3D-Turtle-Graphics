# Python 3D Cube Using Turtle

Controls:  
← → : rotate left and right  
↑ ↓ : rotate up and down (red line shows direction)  
W A S D : move the cube around  
Q E : move the cube up and down

Uses rotation matrices to rotate the 3D points. Includes a perspective camera. I still need to implement a way to order the line rendering from front to back.
To run, download cube.py and run on your own python interpreter. Requires the python turtle and math module.
